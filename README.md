# Analyzing-TV-Data
Python Datacamp Project

Using datasets of Super Bowl game data, TV data and halftime musician data, the goal of this project is to find out how some of the elements of each dataset interact with each other. The goal of this project is to clean and merge the dataset to provide insights about how the Super Bowl affects television viewership, the most prolific musicians in halftime shows, and how viewership, TV ratings and ad cost evolved over time.
